CSC D01 Deliverable #2 Marking Rubric

Overall architecture: _12_ / 15

   _4_ / 5 It is clear to the reader that the team correctly
           understands the architecture of matplotlib.

  Script layer is able to directly interact with backend layer.

   _5_ / 5 A reader, initially unfamiliar with the architecture of
           matplotlib, has a good overview of matplotlib after reading
           the report.

   _3_ / 5 UML diagrams are correct, clear, and helpful.

   The detailed in-between layer diagrams were great, an improvement would be to have diagrams that show the interaction between layers (helps visualize it better)

Design Patterns: _15_ / 15

   Pattern 1:  _5_ / 5
 
      The pattern is actually present in the source code: __ / 3
      The diagrams are correct, clear, and helpful: __ / 2

      Excellent strategy

   Pattern 2:  _5_ / 5
 
      The pattern is actually present in the source code: __ / 3
      The diagrams are correct, clear, and helpful: __ / 2

   Pattern 3:  _5_ / 5
 
      The pattern is actually present in the source code: __ / 3
      The diagrams are correct, clear, and helpful: __ / 2

      pointed out use of callbacks.

Presentation and Quality of Writing: _6_ / 10

  Would have loved to seen the code snippets embeded within the report.

Deliverable 2 - Interview plan

1) Overall Architecture (6 marks)

i)   Ask for a volunteer (V1) -- 2 marks

   Pick an "mpl overall" diagram (or several diagrams) from the team's
   report and ask V1 to point out the major components and their
   tasks.

   2

i)   Ask for a volunteer (V2) -- 2 marks

  Pick 2 components from the diagram V1 was explaining and ask how they
  interact with each other.

  1 - was a little hesistant and nervous in the explanation. 

i)   Ask for a volunteer (V3) -- 2 marks

  Ask to elaborate on something cool about the mpl's design. Don't be
  satisfied with vague answers like "modular", "easy to extend",
  etc. They should be talking about specific components, give specific
  examples.

  1

2) Design Patterns (4 marks)

i)   Ask for a volunteer (V4) -- 2 marks

  Pick one design pattern from the report and ask V4 to show it *in
  the code* of mpl.

  2 - understood what they wrote

i)   Ask for a volunteer (V5) -- 2 marks

  Pick another design pattern from the res-port and ask V5 to show it
  *in the code* of mpl.

  2 - understood what they wrote
